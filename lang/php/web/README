Using the Indri PHP interface:

1) When compiling Indri, use the --enable-php option with the configure
script:
        ./configure --enable-php
You may also have to specify where your php-config script is:
        ./configure --enable-php \
        --with-php-config=/usr/local/apache2/php/bin/php-config
If you have done this correctly, the output will contain the line:
        checking for php includes... found

2) Type 'make' to build Indri.  The PHP library will appear in
indri/swig/obj/php/libindri_php.so.  Install this library somewhere that PHP
can find it.  You may need to talk to your system administrator to 
figure this out.

3) Put the PHP files somewhere that your webserver can find them.

4) Edit the include/config.php file according to the comments in it.
