1. run configure in the main indri directory. Provide
   --with-site-seed=hostname to specify the host to use as a
   seed. Alternatively, after running configure, manually edit the file
   seeds.txt, inserting one hostname per line. configure will create the
   files site-search/build.param, site-search/crawl-index, and
   site-search/seeds.txt. Manually edit the file
   site-search/excluded_hosts to give the urls of any hosts to exclude
   from the crawl. You must include the http:/ prefix on the hostnames.

2. Run make in the indri source tree (if necessary).

3. The script crawl-index will create a directory named crawl within the
   site-search subdirectory of the indri source tree. The location to
   build in will become a parameter later. The script will then run
   heritrix in the crawl subdirectory, placing the trecweb format data
   files in the corpus subdirectory. When the crawler has finished,
   harvestlinks will run over the files in corpus, generating inlink
   data in the linkz subdirectory. When harvestlinks has finished,
   buildindex will run, using the build.param file and default
   stopwords. The output index with be placed in crawl/index/crawl. The
   script will chmod the index to be world readable. The index can be
   moved before use.

4. php ui components

If configured with --enable-php, the PHP library will be installed in
${exec_prefix}/lib/libindri_php.so.  Install this library somewhere that
PHP can find it. You may need to talk to your system administrator to 
figure this out.

The PHP files will be installed in ${prefix}/share/php. Copy the
contents of this directory to somewhere that your webserver can find
them. Edit the include/config.php file according to the comments in it
to set the path to your index, sitename, and document format.

The heritrix crawler (http://crawler.archive.org) has been modified to
include the TrecWebWriterProcessor to emit trecweb formatted
documents. Full documentation/source, available via the website.
