If you have trouble using Indri, check online at lemurproject.org for updated
documentation.  You can also ask a question in the Lemur public
forum, also at lemurproject.org.  The Lemur and Indri developers watch the forum
and can answer your questions.

--------------
What is Indri?
--------------

Indri is a new information retrieval system from the Lemur project; a joint effort
between the University of Massachusetts and Carnegie Mellon University.  It
combines the language modeling and inference network approaches to information
retrieval into one system.

For those who have used the Inquery system, Indri uses a query language that is
very similar, but adds additional features.  In particular, Indri understands 
tagged documents, like HTML and XML documents, and can therefore understand
queries like #1(george bush).person (which means 'find the phrase george bush 
appearing inside a person tag).  Indri can also understand numeric quantities.
You can find out more about the query language in the query language documentation.

We expect that Indri will be useful both for academic research and for certain
industrial applications.  Indri has been released under a permissive open source 
license.  Enterprise support for Indri is available from third parties.

-----------
Using Indri
-----------

Indri comes with three command line programs: buildindex, runquery, and indrid.
In addition, Indri comes with two GUI programs: RetUI and IndexUI.  For many 
research tasks, these tools may meet your needs completely.  However, if your needs
are more complex, you may wish to use Indri as a library and build your own
applications.  You can access Indri from C++, Java or PHP.

Applications: 

The buildindex application can build Indri repositories from TREC formatted documents,
HTML documents, text documents, and PDF files.  Additionally, on Windows it can index Word
and PowerPoint documents.  Buildindex understands tags in HTML/XML documents, and it
can be instructed to index them as well. 

The runquery application evaluates queries against one or more Indri repositories, and
returns the results in a ranked list of documents.  runquery can be instructed to 
print the document text as well, or the text of passages if the query is a
passage retrieval query.

The indrid application is a repository server.  It waits for connections from runquery
(or from other applications using the QueryEnvironment interface) and processes queries
from network requests.  One copy of runquery can connect to many indrid instances at once,
making retrieval using a cluster of machines possible.

Library:

Indri provides the QueryEnvironment and IndexEnvrionment classes, which can be used
from C++, Java or PHP (although indexing is not supported from PHP).  The 
buildindex and runquery applications use these classes exclusively.

IndexEnvironment understands many different file types.  However, you can create your
own file type, as long as it is XML-like, and tell IndexEnvironment how to index it.
Then, using the addFile method, IndexEnvironment can index your document(s).  If you
want to do more complex processing on your data, or if your data is arriving in real time,
you may parse your document into a ParsedDocument structure.  The IndexEnvrionment
object can index these structures directly.

QueryEnvironment allows you to run queries and retrieve a ranked list of results.
You can use runAnnotatedQuery to retrieve match information (annotations), which is
useful for highlighting matched words in documents.  By using the addIndex method
with an instance of IndexEnvironment, you can evaluate queries on an index that
is currently being built.  The addServer method allows you to connect to indrid 
processes for distributed retrieval.

--------------
Building Indri
--------------

Windows: If you are using a Windows machine, use the Visual Studio
solution file provided to build the source tree.  Note that the release
build of this software has Pentium IV optimizations turned on, which may
or may not work on your machine.

Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X:  To build on a Unix variant, first run configure and
then type "make" in the indri directory.  By  default, the project will
build in debug mode, meaning that debug symbols are included.  To run in
release mode (optimizations on, no symbols), type: make STYLE=release 
Be sure to type 'make clean' first to clean out all the old object
files.

configure generates MakeDefns and Makefile.app. configure accepts
following arguments: 
 * --enable-assert: Enable assert statements in the code. Default is
   disabled. 
 * --enable-swig: compiles and installs the swig generated java
   wrappers. Default is disabled. 
 * --with-javahome=<path> Path to JAVAHOME for compiling the swig
   generated shared library.  
 * --with-swig=<path> Path to swig binary. Only required if the wrapper
   interfaces are changed.  
 * --with-php-config=<path> Path to php-config binary. If not specified,
   it will be searched for. If not found, php wrapper generation will
   be disabled.
 * --prefix=<install-directory> Specifies the base directory for
   installation. Default is /usr/local.

Running Indri
-------------

buildindex takes these options:
  memory: (optional) How much memory buildindex should use (default is
  100mb) The value can include a scaling factor by adding a
  suffix. Valid values are (case insensitive) K = 1000, M = 1000000, G =
  1000000000. So 100M would be equivalent to 100000000. The value should
  contain only decimal digits and the optional suffix.

  index: path to where to place the Indri Repository.

  corpus.path: A directory or file that contains the text you want to
  index.

  corpus.class: The FileClassEnviroment of the file or directory
  containing documents to index. The known classes are: 

    html -- web page data. 
    trecweb -- TREC web format, eg terabyte track. 
    trectext -- TREC format, eg TREC-3 onward. 
    doc -- Microsoft Word format (windows platform only). 
    ppt -- Microsoft Powerpoint format (windows platform only). 
    pdf -- Adobe PDF format. 
    txt -- Plain text format. 

  metadata.field: specify the metadata fields to index, eg
  docno. This parameter may appear multiple times. 

  field.name: specify the fields to index as data, eg title. This
  parameter may appear multiple times. 

  field.numeric: the symbol true if the field contains numeric data,
  otherwise the symbol false. Default is false.

  stemmer.name: specify the stemming algorithm to use. Valid options are
  Porter or Krovetz (case insensitive). This is an optional parameter
  with the default of no stemming.  

  stopper.word: specify the stopwords to use. This parameter may appear
  multiple times. This is an optional parameter with the default of no
  stopping.  
	
runquery takes these options:
  memory: (optional) How much memory buildindex should use (default is
  100mb) The value can include a scaling factor by adding a
  suffix. Valid values are (case insensitive) K = 1000, M = 1000000, G =
  1000000000. So 100M would be equivalent to 100000000. The value should
  contain only decimal digits and the optional suffix.

  index: Path to the index(es) you want to query

  server: Name or address of a server running a copy of indrid
  that you want to query (repeat as many times as necessary).  You
  can optionally specify a port after a colon, like this:
  -server=localhost:14576 

  query: The query you want to run

  count: (optional) Number of documents you want to retrieve, at
  most (default is 1000). 

  stopper.word: specify the stopwords to use. This parameter may appear
  multiple times. This is an optional parameter with the default of no
  stopping.  

  rule: specifies the smoothing rule (TermScoreFunction) to
  apply. Format of the rule is:

    ( key ":" value ) [ "," key ":" value ]* 
    For example:

    -rule=method:linear,collectionLambda:0.2,field:title 

    This corresponds to Jelinek-Mercer smoothing with background lambda
    equal to 0.2, only for items in a title field. 

    If nothing is listed for a key, all values are assumed. So, a rule
    that does not specify a field matches all fields. This makes
    -rule=method:linear,collectionLambda:0.2 a valid rule. 

    Valid keys: 

    method: smoothing method (text) 

    field: field to apply this rule to

    operator: type of item in query to apply to { term, window } 

    Valid methods: 

    dirichlet: (also 'd', 'dir') (default mu=2500) 

    jelinek-mercer: (also 'jm', 'linear') (default collectionLambda=0.4,
    documentLambda=0.0), collectionLambda is also known as just "lambda",
    either will work 

    twostage: (also 'two-stage', 'two') (default mu=2500, lambda=0.4) 
    If the rule doesn't parse correctly, the default is Dirichlet,
    mu=2500.

Formatting parameters:

  queryOffset: an integer value specifying one less than the starting

  query number, eg 150 for TREC formatted output.

  runID: a string specifying the id for a query run, used in TREC
  scorable output.

  trecFormat: the symbol true to produce TREC scorable output, otherwise
  the symbol false.

Pseudo-Relevance Feedback Parameters

  fbDocs: an integer specifying the number of documents to use for
  feedback.

  fbTerms: an integer specifying the number of terms to use for
  feedback. 

  fbMu: a floating point value specifying the value of mu to use for
  feedback.

  fbOrigWeight: a floating point value in the range [0.0..1.0]
  specifying the weight for the original query in the expanded query.


indrid takes the following options:
