TERMS / PROXIMITY

Terms:
term -- stemmed / normalized term
"term" -- unstemmed / unnormalized term
#base64( ... ) -- converts from base64 -> ascii and then stems and
normalizes. useful for including non-parsable terms in a query
#base64quote( ... ) -- same as #base64 except the the ascii term is
unstemmed and unnormalized

Examples:
dogs
"NASA"
#base64(Wyh1Lm4ucC5hLnIucy5hLmIubC5lLild) -- equivalent to query term
[(u.n.p.a.r.s.a.b.l.e.)]

Proximity terms:
#odN (ordered window -- terms must appear ordered, with at most N-1 terms
between each)
#N (same as #odN)
#uwN (unordered window -- all terms must appear within window of length N
in any order)

Examples:
#1(white house) -- matches "white house" as an exact phrase
#2(white house) -- matches "white * house" (where * is any word or null)
#uw2(white house) -- matches "white house" and "house white"

Synonyms:
< ... > -- treats all expressions within < > as the same term

Examples:
<dog canine>
<#1(light bulb) lightbulb>

"Any" operator:
#any -- used to match extent types

Examples:
#any:PERSON -- matches any occurence of a PERSON extent
#1(napolean died in #any:DATE) -- matches exact phrases of the form:
"napolean died in <date>...</date>"

ADVANCED TERMS

Field restriction / evaluation:
expression.f1,,...,fN(c1,...,cN) -- matches when the expression appears
in field f1 AND f2 AND ... AND fN and evaluates the expression using the
language model defined by the concatenation of fields c1...cN within the
document.

Examples:
dog.title -- matches the term dog appearing in a title extent (uses
document language model)

#1(trevor strohman).person -- matches the phrase "trevor strohman" when it
appears in a person extent (uses document language model)

dog.(title) -- evaluates the term based on the title language model for
the document

#1(trevor strohman).person(header) -- builds a language model from all of
the "header" text in the document and evaluates #1(trevor strohman).person
in that context (matches only the exact phrase appearing within a person
extent within the header context)

COMBINING BELIEFS

Belief operators:
#sum
#wsum
#wand (weighted and)
#or
#combine
#weight
#max
#not

Examples:
#combine( <dog canine> training )
#combine( #1(white house) <#1(president bush) , #1(george bush)> )
#weight( 1.0 #1(white house) 2.0 #1(easter egg hunt) )

Extent retrieval:
#beliefop[field]( query ) -- evaluates #beliefop( query ) for all extents
of type "field" in the document and returns a score for each. the language
model used to evaluate the query is formed from the text of the extent.

Example:
#combine[sentence]( #1(napolean died in #any:DATE ) ) -- returns a scored
list of sentence extents that match the given query

FILTER OPERATORS

Filter operators:
#filreq -- filter require
#filrej -- filter reject

Examples:
#filreq( sheep #combine(dolly cloning) )
only consider those documents matching the query "sheep" and rank them
according to the query #combine(dolly cloning)

#filrej( parton #combine(dolly cloning) )
only consider those documents NOT matching the query "parton" and rank
them according to the query #combine(dolly cloning)

NOTE: first argument must always be a term/proximity expression
